# pythonpasswordgenerator

Make a new folder called "Password Generator" for it

the most advanced and unnescesary password generator ever created

How the file stuff works:

once you have a password you can encrypt it at the bottom of the window and have it saved, but if you ever need it back because you forgot it, you can decrypt it in the top part of the window.
